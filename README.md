# ra1nsn0w

## Information

This is just my fork of ra1nsn0w that allows you to save the patched kernel to a file

It's added poorly and could be massively improved on but it works fine enough for me =p

May be helpful for those wishing to do tethered downgrades (as AMFI needs to be patched out of the kernel which ra1nsn0w can do), assuming you have a working ASR patch
